🎨 Tileset Manager

A small developer tool to import, preview, slice and prepare tilesets for Unity & 2D games.

🚀 Overview

Tileset Manager is a simple web tool that helps game developers quickly import a tileset image, visualize it, and prepare it for use in Unity, Godot, or other 2D engines.

It’s built to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use — perfect for personal workflows or indie game projects.

This is a side project I’m building to practice and improve my front-end development skills (React), while also creating something useful for my own game dev pipeline.
